            After becoming obsessed with automating google sheets I decided to dip my toe a 
            little deeper intot the world of code..  I started studying Ruby and a few months 
            later had enrolled myself to Northcoders bootcamp based in Manchester. From here I 
            learnt fundamental Javascript which led to me creating fullstack web applications 
            using Node.js, Express.js, Postgresql and React.

            Being a very visual person, my passion tends to lean towards front end.

            In my spare time you can find me playing around in Photoshop and Illustrator, making
            awful music in Ableton, running around the streets of Manchester trying to keep fit
            or doing the occasional lightning talk.  But most likely you will find me playing 
            Apex Legends
